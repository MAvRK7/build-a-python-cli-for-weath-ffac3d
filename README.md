Build a Python CLI for weather forecasting with email alerts

Generated by MACC - Multi-Agent Code Collaborator

"""
Weather CLI: A production-quality Python CLI for weather forecasting with email alerts.

This script provides a command-line interface to fetch current weather forecasts and send email
alerts for specific conditions (e.g., hot, cold, rain) using the OpenWeatherMap API.

Features:
- Fetch current weather for a city (forecast subcommand).
- Check conditions and send email alerts if met (alert subcommand).

Dependencies:
- requests (for API calls)
- python-dotenv (for loading environment variables)
- smtplib, email (standard library for sending emails)
- Install via: pip install requests python-dotenv

Setup:
1. Sign up for a free OpenWeatherMap account at https://openweathermap.org/api and get an API key.
2. Create a .env file in the script directory with:
   API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key
   EMAIL=your_sender_email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password (use Gmail app password, not regular password)
3. For Gmail: Enable 2FA and generate an app password at https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords.
4. Make the script executable: chmod +x weather_cli.py
5. Run examples:
   python weather_cli.py forecast London
   python weather_cli.py alert London hot user@example.com

Usage:
python weather_cli.py <command> [args]
Commands:
  forecast <city>     : Get current weather for the city.
  alert <city> <condition> <email> : Send alert if condition met.
    Conditions: hot (temp > 30°C), cold (temp < 0°C), rain (raining).

Error Handling:
- Logs errors to stderr.
- Graceful failures for invalid cities, API issues, or email problems.
